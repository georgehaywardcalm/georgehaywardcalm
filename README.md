ðŸ¦’ My nameâ€™s George Hayward, and Iâ€™m a Senior Data Scientist. I love data, data science, fried chicken, and engineering. I started my career in finance at Morgan Stanley. After grad school, I learned a ton of best practices at Google and Meta, then built ML from scratch at an acquired startup called HeadsUp, and Iâ€™ve been consulting under Hayward Data Science for ever since. As you might guess, Iâ€™m often busy, so I started using the Calm App after I discovered its partnership with my mentor LeBron James, so Iâ€™m a big believer in the mission.

Outside of work, my life revolves around law, stand-up, and coding. Aside from this, I like to go for runs at a reasonable pace, take photos, and attend late night jazz shows. I am technically a minister in the State of New York also. My favorite producer is J Dilla, Iâ€™m a lifelong Optimist, and you can think of me as a brother to Artemus Ward and Mark Twain.
